## Delta Summary (vs 2026-02-15)

- `New`: **4**
- `Changed`: **3**
- `Unchanged`: **6**
- `Resolved`: **20**

### Notable shifts since last audit

1. Site now has production analytics wiring and benchmark evidence pages backed by synced snapshots.
2. Animation safety checks are runnable and passing in canonical and fixture modes.
3. Phase 1 hardening resolved benchmark source integrity, release immutability enforcement, and sync-token exposure risks.
4. Phase 2 resolved CLI module/runtime contract fragility by moving to ESM-primary packaging with dual export conditions.
5. Phase 2 resolved missing public runner API by shipping stable `@imageforge/cli/runner` with import/require matrix coverage.
6. Phase 3 resolved site UI/motion regression gaps by adding advisory Vitest, Playwright E2E/visual, and LHCI quality gates.
7. Phase 4 restored CI health on both repos and stabilized benchmark-sync formatting with fail-closed producer normalization.
8. Phase 5 added runtime safety hardening (sanitized CLI path logging + chunked hashing) and resolved site header/dependency hardening.
9. Phase 6A decomposed runner/test monoliths and closed targeted edge-case validation gaps in CLI.
10. Phase 6A added advisory coverage artifacts and targeted fault-injection pilots in both repos.
11. Cross-repo workflow action pinning remains enforced via CI policy checks in both repositories.

## Top 10 Highest-Severity Findings

1. `IF-SITE-SEO-023` (Medium) - H1 audit signal remains noisy.
2. `IF-CLI-BENCH-013` (Medium) - Benchmark regression gates remain advisory-only.
3. `IF-CLI-MAINT-002` (Medium) - Node `>=22` policy remains restrictive.
4. `IF-SITE-PROD-020` (Medium) - Pricing claim freshness still relies on static timestamps.
5. `IF-X-TEST-032` (Medium) - Cross-repo coverage governance still lacks mutation-grade effectiveness checks.
6. `IF-CLI-DX-004` (Medium) - No dry-run/include-exclude/init DX workflow yet.
7. `IF-CLI-PROD-005` (Medium) - Source format coverage still excludes webp/avif/svg inputs.
8. `IF-SITE-SEO-024` (Low) - CI SEO advisory output still contains environment-noise warnings.
9. `IF-CLI-MAINT-015` (Low) - Duplicate helper/constants remain in CLI internals.
10. `IF-SITE-MAINT-026` (Low) - No first-party docs/blog/contact routes yet.

## Critical-Path Remediation Order

1. Phase 4/5 hardening completed: keep regressions from reopening resolved items `IF-X-VAL-028`, `IF-CLI-SEC-009`, `IF-CLI-SEC-010`, `IF-X-VAL-029`, and `IF-X-SEC-030`.
2. Keep coverage/fault-injection advisory signals healthy and visible in CI artifacts: `IF-X-TEST-032`.
3. Improve signal quality and claim freshness: `IF-SITE-SEO-023`, `IF-SITE-SEO-024`, and `IF-SITE-PROD-020`.
4. Decide if/when to move benchmark regression thresholds from advisory to strict: `IF-CLI-BENCH-013`.
5. Reassess runtime/DX backlog sequencing: `IF-CLI-MAINT-002`, `IF-CLI-DX-004`, and `IF-CLI-PROD-005`.
